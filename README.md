# CPU_Cache_Simulator

## Overview: üó£Ô∏è 
This project simulates the behavior of a CPU cache system, modeling how data is accessed, stored, and
written between the cache and main memory. It supports key caching strategies such as direct-mapped,
2-way, and 4-way configurations, and simulates typical cache operations. The simulator takes a sequence of
memory accesses as input and tracks how the cache responds to each operation. And then provides insignts into 
how each of the given cache configurations performed.
